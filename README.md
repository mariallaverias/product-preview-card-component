# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (mobile or desktop).

Instead of just using CSS and HTML as the challenge stated, I decided to create a React App to continue practicing creating components, pretending to fetch data and conditionally render and style elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Setup

Run `npm install` on root folder to install all the project dependencies.
